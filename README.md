- Deployed: `~/api/` on servers
- Database: MySQL on `webdb5.uvm.edu`

### Server Structure
```
~/site-src/     # Source code from GitHub
~/api/          # Backend API deployment
~/www-root/     # Frontend build (Apache serves from here)
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Backend API

The backend API provides endpoints for:
- Database listing
- Table metadata
- Location data
- Data downloads (CSV)
